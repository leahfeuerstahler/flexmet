Description: Application of the filtered monotonic polynomial (FMP) item response
    model to flexibly fit item response models. The package includes tools that
    allow the item response model to be build on any monotonic transformation of
    the latent trait metric, as described by Feuerstahler (2016) <http://hdl.handle.net/11299/182267>.
